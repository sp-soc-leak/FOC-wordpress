## Context
There is a module called Fundamentals of Computing, which has an end of year project alongside the interview. Just know that this syllabus will likely change in many ways (FOC was one of the heavily discussed topics for syllabus revamps in a student dialogue).<br><br>
Anyways, the project is about hosting an instance of wordpress on linux on AWS academy. It is honestly pretty easy. And there is a group and individual component. We also needed to create documentation for the group component.
